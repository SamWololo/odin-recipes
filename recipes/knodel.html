        <h2>Description: A carbohydrate-filled snakk</h2>
        <p>Knodel are the German and Austrian equivalent of dumplings. However, I think that description is inadequate. Knodel are composed of bread, egg, milk, parseley, onion, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. They are spherical orbs of bready goodness that soak up soups, sauces, and drippings on the dishes they accompany.</p>
