        <p>The following text will include the ingredients and steps. Don't worry if your lasagna is too cheesy. The more cheese the better, in my opinion. 
        <p>Some lasagna recipes call for pesto. We will be making a nice bolognese lasagna, so don't worry about that.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>½ pound shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>½ pound shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 pint ricotta cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large skillet over medium-high heat, brown beef and season with salt and pepper; drain. Stir in spaghetti sauce and garlic and simmer 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine mozzarella, Cheddar and ricotta; stir well. In 9x13 inch pan, alternate layers of noodles, meat mixture and cheese mixture until pan is filled.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        </ol>
